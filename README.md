## Description

Not sure what to eat tonight? The purpose of this app is to answer that question. When the user clicks the "Gimme Something to Eat" button a random recipe is pulled from "https://www.themealdb.com/" From the same API an image is also pulled for each recipe along with the instructions to make it, its food Type(region) and Category (i.e Seafood, Vegetarian etc).
